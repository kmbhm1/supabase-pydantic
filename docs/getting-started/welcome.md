# Supabase Pydantic

Supabase Pydantic is a Python library that **generates** Pydantic (& other :wink:) models for Supabase (& other :wink:) databases. It is designed to enhance the utility of Supabase as an entity for rapid prototyping and development. 

## Why use supabase-pydantic?

The [supabase-py](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-py) library, along with other Supabase SDKs, currently lacks an automated system to enhance type safety and data validation in Pythonâ€”an essential feature that is readily available and highly useful in the JavaScript/TypeScript library, as outlined in [Supabase's documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#generating-typescript-types).

Pydantic, a popular library for data validation and settings management in Python, leverages type annotations to validate data, significantly enhancing the robustness and clarity of code. While both TypeScript and Pydantic aim to improve type safety and structure within dynamic programming environments, a key distinction is that Pydantic validates data at runtime.

This library aims to bridge the gap, delivering an enriched experience for Python developers with Supabase. It not only replicates the functionalities of the TypeScript library but is also finely tuned to the diverse tools and landscape of the Python community. Moreover, it's designed to turbocharge your workflow, making rapid prototyping not just faster but also a delightful adventure in development.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install supabase-pydantic
